## **Step 1: Compute IBD Using PLINK**
PLINK estimates the proportion of IBD alleles between pairs of individuals. To do this, use the `--genome` flag:

```
./plink --bfile 1kg_hm3 --genome --out ibd_results

```


This will generate an output file (ibd_results.genome) with pairwise relatedness estimates.

## **Step 2: Understanding the IBD Output**
The output file (`ibd_results.genome`) contains several columns. The most relevant for identifying relatives are:

- **PI_HAT**: Estimated proportion of alleles shared identical by descent (IBD).
- **Z0**: Probability that the pair shares **zero** alleles IBD.
- **Z1**: Probability that the pair shares **one** allele IBD.
- **Z2**: Probability that the pair shares **two** alleles IBD.
- **IBS0**: Number of SNPs where both individuals have different alleles (used to detect sample swaps).

### **Interpreting PI_HAT Values**
The **PI_HAT** value helps classify relationships between individuals. Use the following thresholds as a guide:

| **PI_HAT Value** | **Relationship** |
|------------------|------------------------------|
| > 0.9           | Duplicate samples / Identical twins |
| 0.4 - 0.6       | Full siblings |
| 0.2 - 0.4       | Half-siblings / Grandparent-grandchild |
| 0.1 - 0.2       | First cousins |
| < 0.1           | Unrelated individuals |

If PI_HAT is **greater than 0.9**, the individuals are likely **duplicates** or **identical twins**. If it falls between **0.4 and 0.6**, they are likely **full siblings**.

You can also check **Z0, Z1, and Z2** values:
- **Z2 ≈ 1** → The individuals are likely **monozygotic twins**.
- **Z1 ≈ 1** → Indicates **first-degree relatives** (e.g., siblings or parent-child).
- **Z0 ≈ 1** → The individuals are likely **unrelated**.


```
head ibd_results.genome 

```
# Identifying Relatives in a PLINK File Using `awk`

After computing **identity by descent (IBD)** with PLINK, you can use `awk` to filter relationships based on **PI_HAT** values from the `ibd_results.genome` file.

## **Filtering Relatives Using `awk`**

### **1. Find Possible Duplicates (PI_HAT > 0.9)**


```bash
awk '$10 > 0.9' ibd_results.genome
```


Identifies individuals who share more than 90% of their genome, likely duplicate samples or identical twins.

### **2.Find Full Siblings (0.4 ≤ PI_HAT ≤ 0.6)**


```bash
awk '$10 >= 0.4 && $10 <= 0.6' ibd_results.genome
```



### **3. Find Half-Siblings or Grandparent-Grandchild (0.2 ≤ PI_HAT ≤ 0.4)**


```bash
awk '$10 >= 0.2 && $10 <= 0.4' ibd_results.genome
```

### **4. Find First Cousins (0.1 ≤ PI_HAT ≤ 0.2)**


```bash
awk '$10 >= 0.1 && $10 <= 0.2' ibd_results.genome

```

### **5. Find Unrelated Individuals (PI_HAT < 0.1)**


```bash
awk '$10 < 0.1' ibd_results.genome

```
### **How many relatives**

we can use the command `wc -l`

```bash
awk '$10 > 0.9' ibd_results.genome | wc -l
awk '$10 >= 0.4 && $10 <= 0.6' ibd_results.genome | wc -l
awk '$10 >= 0.2 && $10 <= 0.4' ibd_results.genome | wc -l
awk '$10 >= 0.1 && $10 <= 0.2' ibd_results.genome | wc -l
awk '$10 < 0.1' ibd_results.genome | wc -l
```

## **Remove relatives Using PLINK’s `--rel-cutoff` Option**

PLINK provides a built-in option to **prune related individuals** based on their **PI_HAT** values. This ensures that only **unrelated individuals** remain in the dataset.

### **Command to Remove Related Individuals**
```bash
./plink --bfile 1kg_hm3 --rel-cutoff 0.1 --make-bed --out unrelated_samples

```
